/*

INTUITION - We will be given an infinite array.
            The intuition is we search for the element chunk by chunk.
            As it is sorted , if the element at last is smaller than the target element, It is obvious that there will not be the presence of the target.
            Hence, we move to the next chunk.
            The size of the chunk will be increased exponentially.
